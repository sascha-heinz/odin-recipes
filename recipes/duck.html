    <h1>Sous Vide Duck Breast</h1>
    <img src="../images/duck.webp" alt="Duck Breast">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>How about a sous vide duck recipe made with a simple, almost foolproof, stovetop method that requires no special equipment? Too good to be true? 
    Well, I'm happy to report it's so very true, and produced what my wife and I agreed was the best duck breast we've ever had.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) boneless duck breast halves, skin on</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut several very shallow crosswise slashes across the skin of each duck breast about 1/2 inch apart. (The cuts should only barely cut into 
        the skin and fat; don't cut into the meat.) Season skin sides with salt, then generously season meat sides with salt, pepper, and thyme. Place 
        into a heavy-duty resealable plastic bag, squeeze out all the air, and seal. Refrigerate for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Fill a large Dutch oven about 2/3 full with water and place over medium heat; heat to 135 degrees F (57 degrees C). Attach a candy thermometer 
        to the side of the Dutch oven in order to monitor and maintain the water temperature. Place a silicone hot pad into the bottom of the pot to keep 
        the plastic bag from contacting the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Place the sealed plastic bag into the Dutch oven. Cook, moving the bag around occasionally and adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain the 
        temperature at 135 degrees F (57 degrees C), for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Remove duck breasts from the plastic bag and pat dry. Generously season skin sides with salt.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over high heat. Place duck breasts, skin-side down, in the hot skillet until fat renders and skin is golden brown, 5 minutes. 
        Turn breasts over and cook until lightly browned and meat still pink in the center, 1 minute. Let rest for 2 minutes before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
