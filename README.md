# odin-recipes

This repo (repository) was created as part of the online-course "The Odin Project" im going through.

The goal is to learn the basics of webdevelopment. Part of the course is learning the
main programming languages for webdevelopment HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Workflows and
conventions in the world of programmig also will be touched. The course also teaches,
how to use git and GitHub,  which is an important and often used tool (Version Control System) 
for programmers - for private projects and in companies.

In this repo you will find my first project as part of the course.
First of all, i will crate my first site with html. It will be a simple site for different
recipes. Later on i will style this site with css.
